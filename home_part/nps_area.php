                    <h3>Net Promoter Score (NPS)速</h3>
                    <p>Net Promoter Score (NPS速) has become the world standard for measuring customer satisfaction levels.
                        Rather than saying we have the "Best" service we use a 3rd party company to automate follow up
                        messages to our customers including getting feedback and tracking NPS速. CEO Juice is an independent
                        A.I. company with an audited process where every step is controlled by them, the numbers cannot be
                        changed even if we show our customer gave us a low score in error. NPS速 is a scale of -100 to +100
                        and is based on the single question "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague."
                        Like revenue or profit it needs to be for a period of time.</p>
